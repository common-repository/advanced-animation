Animation and figma converter for gutenberg block.

== Description ==
Use this plugin with it's Figma plugin companion to convert Figma design into WordPress block.

Automatically convert figma designs to WordPress blocks. This plugin converts a figma design with an auto layout to a wordpress column, row, header, and image block. The image will be automatically posted to WordPress Media.

This plugin also includes an addon for creating simple to complex animations using the Gutenberg editor. Block parallax animation, fade animation, slide animation, and custom animation are all supported by this plugin. Custom animation can be produced by providing position, rotation, and other block animation properties.

This plugin provides a timeline editor to edit the animation frame by frame. Creating a unique animation is as simple as editing the block properties. No coding required.

The pro edition allows for limitless figma imports and more options for animation properties, as well as custom animation triggers for clicking or hovering blocks.
